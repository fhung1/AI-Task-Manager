# AI-Task-Manager

AI-Task-Manager is a full-stack web application that allows users to input tasks and automatically assigns a priority score using lightweight AI-style heuristics (with a clear path to integrating large language models such as ChatGPT).

The project is built to demonstrate end-to-end product development, including backend APIs, database design, and a typed frontend consuming those APIs.
